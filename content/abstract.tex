Your dissertation abstract goes here. This should be a single
paragraph. Try to keep it as brief as possible (less than 200 words
--- if this abstract page runs onto a second page, it needs
shortening), while keeping in mind that it should touch on all the
important aspects of your research --- consider whether someone
unfamiliar with your research area would be able to determine whether
your research is relevant to them, or not. Keep in mind that the
abstract may be the only thing someone reads before choosing to either
discard your work, or keep reading. Also, make sure that there are no
references in the abstract. The keywords list should include no more
than ten keywords. Keywords may be single words, or multi-word terms
(such as ``neural networks'' or ``particle swarm optimisers''). When
choosing keywords, consider terms that are descriptive of your
research, and are likely to be used in search queries that should find
your work.
